# Machine-Learning

## House_Prices:
In this task, I want to compare the predictive power of various machine learning models for house prices. Specifically, we want to compare KNN, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Support Vector Regression. I will use a dataset of house prices that includes various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
## Recipe_Grouping:
In this task, I want to group recipe information using machine learning techniques. I will use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cluster similar recipes together based on features such as ingredients, cooking time, and cuisine.
## Recipe_Recommended_System:
In this task, I want to create a recipe recommendation system using cosine similarity. I will use a dataset of recipes and their ingredients to calculate the cosine similarity between recipes. Based on this similarity measure, I will recommend similar recipes to users.
## TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset:
In this task, I want to create a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity. I will use a dataset of movies and their features such as genres, actors, and directors to calculate the cosine similarity between movies. Based on this similarity measure, I will recommend similar movies to users.
## Titanic:
In this task, I want to perform survival analysis on the Titanic dataset. Specifically, I want to use Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict the survival of passengers based on their age, sex, and class.
## Wine_Reviews:
In this task, I want to perform descriptive statistics on a dataset of wine reviews. I will analyze features such as the wine's country of origin, variety, and rating to gain insights into the dataset.
## Load_Iris:
In this task, I want to use a Decision Tree model to classify different types of irises based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. I will use the well-known iris dataset for this task.
